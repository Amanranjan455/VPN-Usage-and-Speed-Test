# Steps Performed for Free VPN Usage and Speed Test

1. Installed Proton VPN (Free Plan)
2. Connected to the fastest free server (Japan - JP-FREE#30)
3. Checked IP before VPN:
   - IPv4: 152.58.188.254
   - Location: Muzaffarpur, Bihar, India
4. Checked IP after VPN:
   - IPv4: 149.88.103.41
   - Location: Tokyo, Japan
5. Run speed test before VPN:
   - Download: 37 Mbps
   - Upload: 950 Kbps
   - Latency: 36 ms (unloaded)
6. Run speed test after VPN:
   - Download: 2.6 Mbps
   - Upload: 1.7 Mbps
   - Latency: 181 ms (unloaded)
7. Verified traffic was encrypted via Proton VPN interface

# Observations:
- IP successfully changed after VPN connection
- Internet speed dropped significantly with VPN (common with free servers)
- Latency increased due to routing traffic via Japan server
- VPN provided basic privacy by masking original IP

# Conclusion:
Free VPN is effective for masking IP but comes with speed trade-offs. Useful for privacy but not ideal for high-speed tasks like streaming or gaming.
